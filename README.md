# Connecting Front End to BackEnd SQL Database

- A lesson @ Code Nation that was to get a server runnig addind submitted data to SQL database.

#Tech stack used:

- Fontend HTML with Handlebars.
- Connected with Node - Express.
- Backend SQL database using MySQL.


## Summary so far:

- Created a front end form in html using handlebars templating. Using node-express as my server and now connected this to my backend SQL database. 

- After completion went back through with commenting to cement my understanding. 

- Addtional challenge now completed to create a further table after and additonal form to enter data in.



## Future ideas to test myself

- Would like to now see about creating a JOIN table in mySQL from the two tables and retrieve data back to my browser with all data in one view.
